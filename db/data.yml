    - A harrowing, deeply moving tale of survival and reconciliation by a Rwandan Tutsi who returns to his homeland following the 1994 genocide, is elected Speaker of the Rwanda Parliament, and yet is soon forced into exile once again.
    - "<p>Joseph Sebarenzi did not learn the words \xE2\x80\x9CHutu\xE2\x80\x9D and \xE2\x80\x9CTutsi\xE2\x80\x9D until one day at school, when he watched from his classroom as Hutus in his village burned Tutsis\xE2\x80\x99 homes. Until then, he thought of all the people of his nation as Rwandans. But outbreaks of violence between Hutus and Tutsis escalated, culminating in the 1994 genocide in which an estimated 800,000 Tutsis were killed. Sebarenzi watched the tragedy unfold\xE2\x80\x94and learned about the deaths of his parents, seven siblings, and numerous other relatives\xE2\x80\x94while living in Canada, where his family sent him twenty years earlier to escape the violence.</p>\r\n\
      <p>\r\n\
      Sebarenzi demonstrates how horrific events can occur in places like Darfur and the Congo without the rest of the world\xE2\x80\x99s knowledge and how the lessons of Rwanda can prevent future tragedies from happening. He exposes the corruption of the current government in Rwanda and details how people are taught to believe their fellow humans are less worthy than they are.</p>\r\n"
